# Demo Semantic UI hello world

Demonstration of [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) elements, components, fonts, etc.

https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html

To create the demo, we downloaded these files:

  * semantic/semantic.min.js
  * semantic/semantic.min.css
  * semantic/themes/default/assets/fonts/icons.woff
  * jquery.min.js

The demo is intentionally simple:

  * The implementation uses local files, rather than a content delivery network (CDN).
  * The implementation uses plain CSS and JS, rather than a build tool such as Gulp.
